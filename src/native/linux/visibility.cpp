// Linux desktop environments (X11, Wayland) do not have a robust,
// standardized API for preventing window capture like Windows and macOS.
// This function serves as a placeholder and logs a warning.
//
// Possible avenues for a partial implementation (all with significant drawbacks):
// 1. X11 Composite Extension: Redirecting window content can sometimes hide it,
//    but it's complex and often bypassed by modern screen recorders.
// 2. Wayland: Security is tighter by design, but there's no standard protocol
//    for an application to request capture prevention.
//
// For now, we acknowledge the limitation.
